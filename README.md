# semantic-release-slack-with-files

A custom [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) plugin for sending Slack notifications about new releases, with support for:

- Attaching release assets (e.g., binaries, archives).
- Handling glob patterns and placeholders like `${nextRelease.version}`.
- Detailed release messages, including descriptions, changelogs, and download links.
- Prerelease-specific configurations.
- Robust error handling to notify users if something goes wrong.

## Installation

Install the plugin as a dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install siredmar/semantic-release-slack-with-files -D
```

## Configuration

Add the plugin to your `.releaserc.json` or `.releaserc.js` file. Below is an example configuration:

```json

    { "name": "master" },
    { "name": "beta", "prerelease": true }
  ],
  "plugins": [
    [
      "siredmar/semantic-release-slack-with-files",
      {
        "assets": {
          "dist/myfancytool_${nextRelease.version}_*.tar.gz": "Linux Distributions",
          "dist/myfancytool_${nextRelease.version}_Windows_*.zip": "Windows Distributions"
        },
        "changelog": true,
        "lastCommitText": true,
        "message": "We are excited about our new release of `myfancytool` ${nextRelease.version} 🎉🎉🎉\n\n",
        "lastLine": "_Thank you for your continued support!_ 🙌",
        "prerelease": {
          "changelog": false,
          "lastCommitText": true,
          "message": "🚀 Prerelease: `myfancytool` ${nextRelease.version} 🚧\n\n",
          "lastLine": "_This is an experimental build._ 🔬"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Plugin Options

- **`assets`** (required):
  - A mapping of file paths or glob patterns to labels (e.g., `"dist/file.tar.gz": "Linux Build"`).
  - Supports placeholders like `${nextRelease.version}`.

- **`changelog`** (boolean):
  - If `true`, includes the changelog generated by `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator` in the Slack message.

- **`lastCommitText`** (boolean):
  - If `true`, includes the body of the last commit (excluding the title and any `Signed-off-by`/`Co-authored-by` lines) as a description.

- **`message`** (string):
  - The main release message. Placeholders like `${nextRelease.version}` and `${nextRelease.notes}` are supported.

- **`lastLine`** (string):
  - A custom string appended to the end of the Slack message.

- **`prerelease`** (object):
  - Contains overrides for prerelease branches:
    - **`changelog`** (boolean): Include changelog in prerelease messages.
    - **`lastCommitText`** (boolean): Include the last commit text in prerelease messages.

## Features

### Asset Uploads with Glob Patterns

The `assets` field supports glob patterns, allowing you to upload multiple files easily:

```json
{
  "assets": {
    "dist/myfancytool_${nextRelease.version}_*.tar.gz": "Linux Distributions"
  }
}
```

If any required assets are not found, the plugin will:
- Post an error message in the Slack thread.
- Edit the original announcement to indicate the release should not be used.
- Fail the `semantic-release` pipeline.

### Prerelease Handling

Prerelease branches (e.g., `beta`) can have their own configuration:

```json
{
  "prerelease": {
    "changelog": false,
    "lastCommitText": true,
    "message": "🚀 Prerelease: `myfancytool` ${nextRelease.version} 🚧\n\n",
    "lastLine": "_This is an experimental build._ 🔬"
  }
}
```

This ensures prerelease builds are clearly marked and handled differently.

### Error Handling

If an error occurs during execution:
- A message is posted in the Slack thread with details of the error.
- The original announcement message is updated with a prominent note, advising users not to use the release.

Example of an updated message:

```
🚀 New release: 0.43.0 🎉🎉🎉

📖 Description:
This release is all about bringing it to live.
We took care of preparing everything well and good tested.
Let's hope for the best!
